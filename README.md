## 1.1 Release

1.1 marks the release of new concepts, such as using javascript `prompt` to allow for more customization. I'm hoping to iron out some bugs with updated files soon.

New features:

- Custom title and icons that can be set at runtime
- Works with bookmarklets
- Works on all websites that use <link> tags for their favicons
- Fixed bugs with using in top bar
